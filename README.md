# aiounifi

`aiounifi` is an asynchronous Python library for talking to the UniFi Network Application. It provides a high level `Controller` class which exposes helper interfaces for common API endpoints as well as realtime event handling over websockets.

See the [documentation](docs/index.md) for usage examples and a description of all interfaces.
Additional details on every data model can be found in [docs/models.md](docs/models.md).
